Introduction
=============

Putting on a community event - no matter how small, or how large, can be a
daunting task. It involves a delicate series of balancing acts - financial,
social, theme and scope. It is also possibly one of the most rewarding things
you may ever do.

Make no mistake though - it is an investment, an investment of your time, money
and other resources, which is fraught with pitfalls. However, when at the end
of your event people come up to you and shake you and your volunteers' hands,
pat you on the back and thank you, you will know it was worth it.

By reading this guide you can navigate the pitfalls and avoid many of the
mistakes that many of us have made. We hope to provide to you enough resources
and pointers so that you can hit the ground running and put on an amazing event
for our community.

History

TBD: Discuss the history of events within the Python community.

Picking your event
------------------

This may sound odd; but before you go much further, you need to think about
what kind of event you wish to put on. Are you thinking of going small - a single
track with short talks, spanning maybe one or two days, or a larger event,
spanning most of a week, with several tracks, longer talks, tutorials, and
perhaps ancillary events such as sprints?

TBD: Expand on ways events can differ - number of days, number of tracks,
geographic range (local, regional, national), breadth of subject matter,
number of attendees, cost, amenities, etc.
